if we want to push our code on github, open folder which contains codes and do cmd.
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/mohitjhankal/Bulk-allocation-microservice.git
git push -u origin main

now we have push the code on github and we made new changes to code and want to push those changes on same branch.

go to folder and do cmd

first check status to check what changes will be there

-> git status
-> git add .
-> git commit -m "commit_remark"
-> git push origin branch_name

settings -> developer settings -> personal access tokens -> tokens to generate token
-> whimsical

Trunk based development -> You create a new branch.
You write and commit your code.
You push the commits to the remote repo on GitHub.
You open a Pull Request (PR).
You wait for the Continuous Integration pipelines to pass.
You request a review from other developers and discuss the code.
Once the PR is approved you merge it to the main branch.

1 . One important part is that you can't push commits directly to the main branch.

Thus our first step is to create a new branch. We can use the -b option to create and check out a branch at the same time. Since this will be the first move of the first game let's use the name move-1-1.

this code we write in VSCode
PS C:\Users\mohit.jhankal\desktop\github\profydev\github-minesweeper-mohitjhankal> git checkout -b move-1-1

git checkout -b move-1-1
